What is a coordinate space? Definined by:
- A point, the origin.
- n basis vectors, that the define the direction and unit size of each axis (n is the number of dimensions of the space).



EXERCISE

Clip space:
    - (0, 0) is the center of the canvas
    - (-1, -1) is the top left corner of the canvas
    - (1, 1) is the bottom right corner of the canvas

Canvas space:
    - (0, 0) is the top left corner of the canvas
    - (canvas width, canvas height) is the bottom right corner of the canvas


Define a transformation that converts clip space coordinates to canvas space coordinates. This will be a combination of scale, rotation and translation matrices (any of which might be identity). The image should be a 5 red points arranged in a diamond on the canvas, with the width and height being have those of the canvas.
